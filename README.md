# "More complex" games

![Games screens collage](https://github.com/Tsubanee/GameDev/blob/master/White%20Simple%20Camera%20Photo%20Collage.png)

The games in these repos were created with the help of online tutorials (like majority of the bases for my further projects... Afterall it's faster to learn from the work well done by others).

### The games I created could be feautured as:
- [2D platformer shooter](https://github.com/Tsubanee/GameDev/tree/master/PlatformerShooter2D)
- [2D tile based farming rpg](https://github.com/Tsubanee/GameDev/tree/master/Farming%20RPG%20GameMaker)
- [3D (view from above) Rpg.](https://github.com/Tsubanee/GameDev/tree/master/RPG%20Tutorial%20Brackeys)

These games were created only as a learnining project to improve the knowledge of game programming, therefore they do not include any story nor "game-design", which would make them addicting to play.
